# General approach

We will keep a tally of these activities here.  Every day, 15 minutes of R activity.

# Project based

## Project 1:  Trust as a latent entity

Let's figure out how to model Trust as a latent entity.  What you will learn:

1. EFA
2. Model inspection
3. Fit evaluation
4. Psychometrics
5. R coding

Things to do:
1. Decide on the data
2. Get some objectives line up
3. Operationalize said objectives

```{r Data}
dat <- read.csv("./dat5alll.csv",header=TRUE)[,-1]
library(psych)
describe(dat)
```

```{r Steps2Objs}

```

```{r Models}

```

```{r EvalModels}

```

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
